# grid-mode
Chrome extension for highlighting borders. Permissions in manifest limit it to `*.dev` and `*.icisapp.com` hosts. This extension is not published in the Chrome store.

Toggling on grid mode will persist, across tabs (provided they are Iora apps) and browser sessions, until you toggle it off.
