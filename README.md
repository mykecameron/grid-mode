# grid-mode
Chrome extension for highlighting borders. Permissions in manifest limit it to `*.dev` and `*.icisapp.com` hosts. This extension is not published in the Chrome store.

Toggling on grid mode will persist, across tabs (provided they are Iora apps) and browser sessions, until you toggle it off. Toggle state is controlled via the extension button.

## Installation

* clone this repo
* go to chrome://extensions/ and check the "Developer Mode" box
* click "Load unpacked extension" and select the extension's source directory from the file chooser
* bask in the glory of magenta borders
